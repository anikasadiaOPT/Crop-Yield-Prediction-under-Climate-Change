# Climate-Agriculture Shock–Recovery Atlas: A 33-Year Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Global Agricultural Resilience Using ECMWF and FAOSTAT Data


Short description:

This repository contains code and workflows used to build the Climate Shock–Recovery Atlas for global agriculture. The atlas links country-level crop production data (FAOSTAT) with gridded climate predictors (ECMWF ERA5 / ERA5‑Land), implements preprocessing and quality checks, and produces cleaned datasets and indicators used in modelling shock and recovery dynamics.

Key features
- Reproducible data-processing pipelines for harmonizing FAOSTAT and ERA5-derived predictors.
- Scripts to aggregate gridded climate data to countries (area-weighted) and compute seasonal predictors.
- Cleaned, documented output tables ready for modeling and visualization.

Project status
- Data collection and preprocessing: implemented (scripts in /scripts)
- Processed datasets stored in: /data (keep sensitive or proprietary outputs out of the public repo)
- Analysis & visualization scripts: in /notebooks and /src (if present)

Quick start
1. Clone:
   git clone https://github.com/anikasadiaOPT/Climate-Shock-Recovery-Atlas-for-Global-Agriculture-.git
2. Create a Python environment:
  ```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Data access:
   - FAOSTAT: download country-level crop tables (see Data sources & licensing below).
   - ERA5/ERA5‑Land: obtain via Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) API or ECMWF resources (see Data sources & licensing).
   Place raw downloads under data/raw/ following the README in /data or the scripts' configuration.

Data sources & licensing (important)
This project uses third-party data with their own licenses and attribution requirements. You must read and comply with those licenses before re-using or redistributing the raw or derived datasets.

Processing overview (high level)
1. Download raw FAOSTAT country-level crop tables and ERA5/ERA5-Land variables (t2m, tcc, tp, ssr, si10).
2. Harmonize country identifiers (ISO3), crop names, and year ranges.
3. Reproject and aggregate ERA5 to country polygons (area-weighted) and compute seasonal statistics (e.g., growing-season mean t2m, cumulative tp).
4. Quality checks: range checks, missingness reports, and minimal imputation where justified (documented in scripts).
5. Store cleaned tables in data/processed with provenance metadata (source URLs, query details, processing date).

Provenance & reproducibility
- Keep raw downloads outside version control (data/raw).
- Log exact download queries, API calls, and parameter selections in scripts and in per-run metadata files saved to data/processed/provenance/.
- If you publish processed datasets, include:
  - link to original data provider(s),
  - citation text,
  - date of download,
  - scripts and exact commit hash used to generate the artifact.
